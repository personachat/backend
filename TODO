# TODO

* Fine-tune the model on the chat personalities. 
* Update prompt in `helper` to make it more accurate
* Make API, save prompt to text file, and allow user to load text file by filename to continue chat later
* Collect RLHF-like data with upvoting and downvoting to create a dataset, in hopes of eventually training a finetuned model
  * Separate `Helper` dataset from Persona dataset, because `Helper` has access to APIs
